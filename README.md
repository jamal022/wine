# Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline for Red Wine Quality Prediction Model

This GitHub repository contains the code and configuration files to create a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline for a machine learning model used to predict the quality of red wine. The CI pipeline automates the process of testing the model whenever changes are made to the codebase. This ensures that the model's performance remains consistent and that any issues are caught early in the development process.
